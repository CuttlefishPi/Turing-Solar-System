# Turing-Solar-System
Old code I made for fun.

This repository consists of some code a wrote a while back to make a simple solar system simulator. 
It uses some basic physics to attract randomly spawned particles together to form larger objects.

CONTROLS:
Movement: Click and hold the left mouse button and drag the mouse to move around in space.
Display: Click the square in the bottom left hand corner of the run window to toggle tracing the object paths.
Frame of Reference: When you right click green numbers will appear next to the "planets". Type in the number of one of the planets and press enter.
The motion of all objects will now be viewed from the frame of reference of a single object. 
This can yield some cool results such as being able to view retrograde orbits.
To go back to the frame of reference of the back ground simply right click and type -1.
